# Software-Development-Plane-Management

This repository contains a project that demonstrates a Java based terminal application that simulates an airplane ticket booking system, allowing users to manage seats, view available seats, book or cancel tickets, and view seating arrangements.

This project was completed as part of my first year Software Development II module in the BSc Data Science and Analytics course at the University of Westminster.
